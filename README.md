# My Engineering Odyssey

> A public journal and digital workshop documenting my journey to mastering Full-Stack, AI, and Systems Engineering.

This repository is the central hub for all my notes, exercises, and reflections as I follow a structured curriculum of reading, practice, and building. The goal is not just to learn to code, but to understand the first principles of computation, design, and systems architecture.

## The Philosophy

The approach is methodical, building knowledge layer by layer:
1.  **The Bedrock:** Computer Science, Programming Logic, and Design Principles.
2.  **The Core Structure:** Full-Stack & Backend/Frontend Craftsmanship.
3.  **The Data & Intelligence Layers:** Data Engineering, MLOps, and AI.
4.  **The Apex:** Specialization and Mastery.
