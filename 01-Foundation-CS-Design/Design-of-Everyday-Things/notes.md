[ Notes on The Design of Everyday Things ]()

# Preface

### Concepts
Good design is harder to notice than poor design.
- Good designs fit the users needs so well that the design is invisible
- Bad designs, are easily noticeable, because of their inadequacies.

`Good observation skills + Good design principles = Powerful design`

We are also designers.
- We design our lives, rooms, actions, etc.









### Concept: Affordances & Signifiers

* **Affordance:** This is the *relationship* between an object and a personâ€”what the object allows you to do. A chair affords sitting. A knob affords turning. It's not a property of the object alone.
* **Signifier:** This is the *clue* that tells you what the affordance is. The flat, wide surface of a chair is a signifier for sitting. The textured grip on a knob is a signifier for turning.

### Example: A Confusing Door

I encountered a glass door at a local shop today. It had a large, vertical bar handle, which is a powerful **signifier** for "pull." But the door actually slid open. The affordance was sliding, but the signifier was for pulling. This mismatch is a classic example of poor design.

### Application: My Future Projects

When I design a button on a website, the affordance is "clicking." The signifiers will be crucial: a rectangular shape, a shadow to make it look raised, and a color change when the mouse hovers over it. I must ensure my signifiers always match the intended action.
